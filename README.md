# PupSense
PupSense is an IoT and ML based app that helps dogs in case of accidents by detecting their sounds and alerting the app. It uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers to analyze the audio properties of a dog's bark and determine if it is in distress due to an accident. The app then updates data in Firebase, which notifies app users and NGOs nearby who can help the dog using nearby hospital locations shown in the app.

The solution also includes the use of cameras and built-in microphones in society cameras to increase its use cases. Additionally, PupSense can be used with a cost-effective IoT device that includes a microphone and GPU module.

# Getting Started
To get started with PupSense, download the app from the app store and create an account. Once you've logged in, you'll be taken to the home screen, where you can enable sound detection and notifications.

# Using PupSense
PupSense uses advanced technology to identify when a dog is in distress. If the app detects a sound, it will use its ML-based solution to determine if the dog is in distress due to an accident. If so, it will send an alert notification to all users within a certain radius. The notification will include directions to the incident location and information about nearby hospitals.

If you're near the incident location, you can use the directions provided by the app to reach the dog quickly. Once you've arrived, you can use the information about nearby hospitals to take the dog to the nearest facility for treatment.

After the incident is resolved, you can create a blog post about your experience. This will help other users learn from your experience and potentially save more dogs in the future.

# Privacy

# Conclusion
PupSense is a valuable tool for dog owners and lovers alike. By detecting dogs in distress using ML-based technology and providing directions to the incident location, and information about nearby hospitals, PupSense can help save lives. Additionally, by creating blog posts about their experiences, users can help others learn from their experiences and potentially save more dogs in the future. The app's IoT capabilities and integration with cameras and microphones in society cameras further extend its use cases, and it can be used for other animals as well.
