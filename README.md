# PupSense
PupSense is an IoT and ML based app that helps dogs in case of accidents by detecting their sounds and alerting the app.
It is a solution for all animal lovers and the ones hoping to change the scenario around.
It uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers to analyze the audio properties of a dog's bark and determine if they are in distress due to an accident. The app then updates data in Firebase, which notifies app users and NGOs nearby who can help the dog using nearby hospital locations shown in the app.

The solution also includes the use of cameras and built-in microphones in society cameras to increase its use cases. Additionally, PupSense can be used with a cost-effective IoT device that includes a microphone and GPU module.

# Getting Started
To get started with PupSense, download the app from the app store and create an account. Once you've logged in, you'll be taken to the home screen, where you can enable location and notifications.

# Using PupSense
PupSense is an automated to solution to save dog lives. If the app detects a sound, it will use its ML model to determine if the dog is in distress due to an accident. If so, it will send an alert notification to all the users nearby. The notification will include directions to the incident location and information about nearby veterinary and NGOs.

If you're near the incident location, you can use the directions provided by the app to reach the dog quickly. Once you've arrived, you can use the information about nearby veterinary to take the dog to the nearest facility for treatment. You may also contact the NGO for any kind of help.

After the incident is resolved, you can share your experience via posts. This will help other users learn from your experience and potentially save more dogs in the future.


The ML model could be loaded to the security cameras of different societies and nearby areas, where any voluntary dog lover can install the app and send the help immediately in case of any incident. So, a person from each society, NGOs and different animal lovers registered to the application can come together to save the lives of these beautiful creatures.

# Future Scope
The solution versatility could be extended to different animals and technology, to take the audio and video input. Its use case could be further extended to variety of animals. 

# Conclusion
PupSense is a valuable tool for dog owners and lovers alike. By detecting dogs in distress using ML-based technology and providing directions to the incident location, and information about nearby veterinary, PupSense can help save lives. Additionally, by creating blog posts about their experiences, users can help others learn from their experiences and potentially save more dogs in the future. The app's IoT capabilities and integration with cameras and microphones in society cameras further extend its use cases, and it can be used for other animals as well.
